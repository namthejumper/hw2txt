# hw2txt
A script on Windows, Linux, and macOS to output your hardware information to .txt file. 
This can help you if you want to share your PC specs to others.
# Notes 
- This was made so it doesn't required any dependency.
- Can use Linux file the same as macOS due to similarity to each others.
- Please run root/sudo if you are on Linux
- Please issues any problem found in my scripts since this is my first project
